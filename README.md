# Poetry Prompts

This is a Python script that reads a CSV of poetry prompts, randomly selects one I have not done and then sends them to my e-mail, at a schedule I set using `crontab`. 

For information about setting up non-gmail email services please references the [stmplib docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)

For more detailed information (instead of a CSV it references Notion), check the blog post below.
